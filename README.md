## 📌 Overview

**Krushi Sakha** is an AI-powered smart farming platform designed to bridge the gap between fragmented agricultural data and real, actionable guidance for farmers. By combining crop prediction, disease detection, real-time weather forecasting, market price analysis, and multilingual AI support into a single ecosystem, Krushi Sakha empowers farmers to make data-driven decisions every day.

---

## 🚜 Problem Statement

Agriculture supports over 58% of India's population, yet farmers — especially the 80% who are small and marginal — lack access to real-time digital decision support. Critical challenges include:

- Unpredictable weather patterns affecting crop planning
- Rapid spread of crop diseases without early detection
- Volatile market prices and poor market access
- Fragmented apps offering isolated, incomplete solutions

**There is a clear need for a unified, AI-driven system that converts raw farm data into simple, explainable daily action plans.**

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Krushi Sakha processes farmer inputs (soil data, location, crop images, and specific requirements) through a suite of AI/ML models and delivers personalized recommendations and action plans.

**Technology Stack:**
- Machine Learning models for crop prediction
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for disease detection (99%+ accuracy)
- Real-time Weather API integration
- Market Data Analytics for price trend prediction
- Multilingual AI Chatbot (Hindi, Odia, Telugu, and more)

**Flow:**
```
Farmer Input → AI Processing (ML Models + APIs) → Personalized Recommendation & Action Plan → Improved Productivity & Profit
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone, set up, and run Krushi Sakha locally on your machine.

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before you begin:

- [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- `pip` (comes with Python)

You can verify your installations by running:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
git --version
```

---

### 📥 Step 1 – Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Krushi Sakha.git
cd Krushi Sakha
```

---

### 🐍 Step 2 – Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it — on Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate it — on macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 📦 Step 3 – Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 🗄️ Step 4 – Set Up the Database

Krushi Sakha uses **SQLite3**, which requires no external setup. Just run the following command to initialize the database and create all required tables:

```bash
python setup_db.py
```

This will generate a `Krushi Sakha.db` file in your project directory automatically.

---

### 🔑 Step 5 – Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then open `.env` and fill in your values:

```env
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
MARKET_API_KEY=your_market_data_api_key
```

> 💡 You can get a free Weather API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).

---

### ▶️ Step 6 – Run the Application

```bash
flask run
```

The app will start on **http://127.0.0.1:5000** by default. Open this URL in your browser to access Krushi Sakha.

---

### 🤖 Step 7 – Run the AI Models (Optional)

To test the crop prediction and disease detection models independently:

```bash
# Run crop prediction model
python models/crop_prediction.py

# Run disease detection model
python models/disease_detection.py
```

---

### 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```
